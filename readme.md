Spectral Blockchain Processor
A comprehensive prototype of a spectral computing machine for blockchain, inspired by QFC and QFM. It simulates an onchain processor with quantum-like elements: interference for consensus, spectral invariants for validation.
What's New in the Extension

QWASM Integration: Quantum-Inspired WASM for operator execution (shift, interference).

Installation


Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run: python main.py

Description

Simulates blockchain as an operator field.
Uses the SMRK Hamiltonian for state evolutions.
QWASM: Custom interpreter for instructions (shift_forward, shift_backward, apply_interference).
Interference: Resolves forks as projections onto eigenmodes.
Audit: Logs traces for replay.
